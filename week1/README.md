## Day 1 Challenge
'''
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

# Mathematical context, real-world use and realizations
This is the problem of **Two sum**, modelled by the equation a + b = T
In a typical transaction scenario, you might be asking which two actions explain a final state. For example, _Transactions = [+500, 200, 300, -5000]_. Notice that there are specific two conditions, +500 and -500 cancel out to give a final state of zero. 
The current solution works by brute force. There is an optimized solution which handles this without brute force.
